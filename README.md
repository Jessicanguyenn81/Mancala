# Mancala
Mancala is a two-person game, it's played on a rectangular board with 12 pods total, 6 pods on each side, and two mancala goal posts on either end. Each pod has 4 marbles, 24 marbles each side, 48 marbles total. The goal is to get as many marbles in your Mancala as possible and whoever has the most marbles in the end wins. 

# How To Start
Player 1 is the blue pods and Player 2 is the green pods, when its the player's turn they pick a pod on their side and move counter-clockwise. Start playing by picking up the 4 marbles and it will distribute 1 marble in each consective pod. Players can drop a marble in their own Mancala but not in their opponents. The game ends when either side has no more marbles in their pods. Whatever remaining marbles in the small pods will not be counted only the marbles in the mancala will be registered. The game will count who has the most marbles, and they will WIN! If both sides have the same amount of marbles its a DRAW!
